# TOP-landing-page

This is an assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).
It is the first full page design assigned. The assignment can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

## Desired output

I am starting this project from scratch and shooting for a desired output of:

![Desired Output](./images/01.png?raw=true "Landing Page")

**Please note:**

The assignment gives the leeway to personalize the page to our own liking as long as we use the styling and layout given in the project. I intend to push a commit that gives an 'Assignment Complete' that matches the desired output as closely as I can get it, then I will play with different content stuff to personalize it. I am looking forward to this challenge!
